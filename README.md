## 📝 Overview
This project is my first mock website, built using HTML and CSS! It's a website that showcases not only some nail art, but my front-end skills as well!

## 🧑‍💻 User Stories
-As a user, I want to browse a gallery of nail designs so I can choose a style I like.

-As a user, I want to easily navigate the website and find the booking section.

-As a user, I want the form to be simple and not complicated.

-As a user, I want confirmation that my booking was submitted successfully.

-As a user, I want the site to be mobile-friendly so I can book from my phone.

## 🚀 How to Use
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Browse through the 3 pages of the website.
- Enjoy the art!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

## 🌱 Ideas for Future Improvement
1. Add JavaScript so the booking can process more interactively and be saved.
2. Integrate a calendar so clients can choose a specific date and time.
3. Add a section for client reviews.
