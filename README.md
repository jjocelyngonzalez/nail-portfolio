# Nail-Portfolio 💅

## 👩‍🎨 Created by
Jocelyn Gonzalez :D

## 📝 Overview
This project is my first mock website, built using HTML and CSS! It's a nail art portfolio that showcases not only the art, but my front-end skills as well!

## 🚀 How to Use
- Open `index.html` in your browser.
- Browse through the different sections of the portfolio.
- Enjoy the art!

## 🛠️ Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS

## 🌱 Ideas for Future Improvement
1. Add JavaScript functionality for interactive elements (like image sliders or modals).
2. Connect to a real database or API to dynamically load portfolio items.
3. Add a contact form with validation and email support.
